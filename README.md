# DollarMountainBookkeeping

## Starting the data jobs

We use shell scripts to trigger the bookkeeping jobs. The process cna be started using any of the following:

1. Run the install script to create a daily task schedule. On windows this creates a task in windows task scheduler. On all other operating systems, this makes a cronjob. This is preferred for less technical users that just want this to run automatically.
2. Navigate to src/autorun and run the shell scripts directly. They can be triggered with an argument for the date to run it
